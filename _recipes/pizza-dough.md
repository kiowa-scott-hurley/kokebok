* `1  3/4 cups` warm water
* `2 tsp` yeast
* `625 g` plain flour
* `2 tsp` salt
* `2 tbsp` olive oil

> Combine ingredients and mix well until flour is incorporated and dough forms, about 5 minutes.

---

> Lightly dust a surface with flour. Knead the dough until it looks smooth, 3-4 minutes. 

---

> Put dough in the fridge, covered, to rise overnight. 

---

> Let come to room temperature, and divide dough into 6 pieces. (Whatever is not being used can be left in the fridge for a few days.) 
>
> Form each piece into a small ball. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. 

---

> Heat oven as hot as it goes. Roll and stretch each ball out into a pizza shape. Dock the pizza, and cook for 10 minutes. 
>
> Add toppings, then cook for an additional 10 minutes.
