* `200 ml` milk

>>> Personal Recipe Notes
>
> These scones may take a bit longer to bake due to the dense ingredients in them. They're also delicious with some grated parmesan or pecorino on top.  
>
> Rubbing in the butter can be done with a food processor. It can also be made easier by freezing the butter and grating it into the flour mix before rubbing it in.
